;;; Commentary:

;; A sensible fuzzy file chooser with a beautiful Mac OS X GUI.
;; This version replaces peeopen.el's dependency on the heavy-weight
;; textmate mode with a lighter weight dependency on jrockway's eproject
;; needed only for identifying the root directory of a project
;;
;; Calls the external PeepOpen.app when you hit Meta-t (or equivalent) in eproject-mode.

;;    M-t - Go to File

;;; Installation:

;; This plugin assumes that you've already loaded Jonathan Rockway's
;; eproject.el in your emacs configuration. Load this file afterward.
;;
;; Copy this file to ~/.emacs.d/vendor/eproject-peepopen.el
;;

;; You'll also need eproject.el:
;;
;;   $ cd ~/.emacs.d/vendor
;;   $ git clone https://github.com/jrockway/eproject.git

;; Require both libraries and activate eproject.
;; In most Emacs distributions, you'll do this in ~/.emacs.d/init.el
;; or your personal configuration file.
;;
;; In Aquamacs, this goes in ~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el.

;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/vendor/eproject.el")
;;   (require 'eproject)
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/vendor/")
;;   (require 'eproject-peepopen)

;; For Emacs 23 or Aquamacs, use this to open files in the existing frame:
;;
;;   (setq ns-pop-up-frames nil)
