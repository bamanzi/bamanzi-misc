A command line interface for jshint, using jsdb as the engine.

jsdb is a *fast* and *easy* to install js engine, with very quick
startup (unlike rhino ;-) ), thus very suitable for commandline js apps.
It also has a rich API for different things like file I/O, networking
and so on. See http://www.jsdb.org/ .

JSHint is a very flexible tool to detect errors and potential problems in JavaScript
code and to enforce coding conventions. See http://jshint.com/ .

This project gives you the ability to run jshint using the jsdb engine with a
very simple commandline interface :
jshint yourfile.js

It will show you the potential problems with your code as a result.
