Based on Gabriele Lanaro's Emacs-for-Python
https://github.com/gabrielelanaro/emacs-for-python

with the following changes
 * disable ropemacs by default
 * autoload ropemacs when .ropeproject dir found
 * 
 * add an easy-to-use menu, you can invoke most stuff here
   - toggle auto-complete sources
   - invoke syntax checking with pylint/pep8/pyflakes/pychecker 
   - turn on/off flymaker, and switch flymaker between pylint/pep8/pyflakes/pychecker

 * add some third-party tools: pylookup gpycomplete


 * removed Gabriele Lanaro's personal preferences (epy-bindings, epy-editing)
